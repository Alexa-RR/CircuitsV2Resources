# V2.7

## General Changes

* Large circuit graphs are less likely to disconnect players in certain scenarios. Specifically:
    * Rooms without spawners tolerate much larger graphs.
    * Rooms without active maker pens tolerate much larger graphs.
    * Rooms with active maker pens tolerate much larger graphs, but only after save.
    * We will continue to improve the experience for large graphs but this should solve the most pressing issues.
* `Log Screen`s will now display errors which cause circuit graphs to stop running
