# V2.10

## Breaking Changes

These changes may require you to update your rooms.

* `SFX V2` is synchronized by default but has an option to disable synchronization.
* Many objects no longer check authority and can now be set by anyone. Objects without authority checks include:
  * `Piston V2`
  * `Rotator V2`
  * `SFX V2`
* Note that setting an object from non-authority may incur additional network overhead.
* Networked operations now expend additional network heat.
* RPCs (some object chips) and synced events are now limited at 5-per frame.
