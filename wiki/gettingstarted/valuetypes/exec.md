The ``` exec ``` value type is used to execute circuitry. Signals of this type are generated by ``` Event Receiver ``` chips. When a signal of this type is received by a chip, the chip is "executed"; for example, it performs an operation on its inputs and updates its outputs. "Executing" a variable chip will set the variable's value to the value on its input port.
